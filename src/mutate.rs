//! Creating, deleting and renaming entries in a volume that already
//! exists.
//!
//! [`Populator`](crate::Populator) writes into a volume this crate has
//! just formatted, over an extent it *knows* is free. [`Mutator`] is the
//! other case, and the one milestone 3 is about: a volume somebody else
//! wrote — the ROM's FFS, xdftool, a guest that crashed mid-write — opened
//! read-write, changed in place. Every block it hands out comes from that
//! volume's own bitmap through [`Allocator`], every block it gives back
//! goes there too, and the order the writes go down in is the whole of the
//! crash safety, because the format has no journal.
//!
//! # What it will not touch
//!
//! A volume whose root says `bitmap_flag == 0` is refused outright
//! ([`AllocError::BitmapInvalid`], surfaced as [`MutateError::Alloc`]).
//! Those bits are whatever an interrupted update left behind and an
//! allocator acting on them hands out blocks a file is using;
//! [`Volume::repair`](crate::Volume::repair) is the operation that turns
//! such a volume back into one there is something to allocate from. That
//! refusal is inherited from the allocator rather than reimplemented here.
//!
//! # Write order, per operation
//!
//! Three rules, applied everywhere, each stated again at the operation
//! that uses it:
//!
//! 1. **Bitmap first when allocating.** A block is marked, the page
//!    carrying its bit is flushed, and only then may its number appear in
//!    anybody's pointer — which [`Allocator::reference`] enforces by
//!    refusing until the flush has happened. Crash anywhere in that order
//!    and the block is allocated and unreachable: a leak
//!    ([`Finding::OrphanBlock`](crate::Finding::OrphanBlock)), which a
//!    [`repair`](crate::repair) fixes.
//! 2. **Content before the pointer that reaches it.** Data blocks,
//!    extension blocks, comment blocks and the header itself are complete
//!    on the disk before the parent's hash slot names the header. The last
//!    write of a create is a single longword in the parent, and until it
//!    lands nothing in the directory has changed.
//! 3. **Bitmap last when freeing.** The entry is spliced out of its
//!    parent's chain (and out of its target's link chain, where it is a
//!    link) and *that* write is on the disk before a single bit is
//!    cleared. Crash anywhere in that order and the blocks are, again,
//!    leaked rather than handed to a second owner.
//!
//! Every intermediate state is therefore either the old volume, the new
//! volume, or the old volume plus some leaked blocks. What never happens
//! is [`Finding::ReachableButFree`](crate::Finding::ReachableButFree) —
//! and unlike a populate, the bitmap flag stays −1 throughout, because at
//! no point does the bitmap claim a reachable block is free. The crash
//! sweep in `tests/volumes.rs` asserts exactly that, at every prefix of
//! every operation's writes.
//!
//! # `unlink`/`release`: freeing an entry in two calls instead of one
//!
//! [`Mutator::delete`] is a single call because most callers have no
//! reason to want otherwise — but a FUSE adapter does. POSIX's
//! create-then-unlink is ordinary use, not a corner case: a program opens
//! a file, unlinks it (a temporary file that cleans itself up even if the
//! program is killed), and keeps reading and writing through the handle
//! it already has. A filesystem that frees a file's blocks the moment its
//! last directory entry disappears breaks that program the instant it
//! touches the handle again, and a FUSE adapter has no seam to intercept
//! it at unless the crate underneath offers one: directory-entry removal
//! and block release have to be two operations, because *its* last handle
//! closing may be seconds or hours after the unlink, in an entirely
//! different call.
//!
//! [`Mutator::unlink`] and [`Mutator::release`] are that split.
//! `unlink` is everything [`Mutator::delete`] does short of clearing a
//! bitmap bit — the entry is gone from its directory, its dircache is
//! regenerated, the parent's date is stamped, and it returns the header
//! block's LBA, which is the handle a caller holds until every reader of
//! it is done. `release` takes that LBA back and does the rest: verify
//! the header is genuinely unreachable, then free its header, its
//! extension blocks, its data blocks and its comment block. Splitting the
//! call in two is a factoring rather than a new discipline, because
//! `unlink` was already the first half of `delete`'s own write order (the
//! module documentation above states it as rule 3, "bitmap last when
//! freeing") — `delete` is now defined as `unlink` immediately followed
//! by `release` on the LBA it returns, and there is exactly one
//! implementation of each half.
//!
//! **The state in between is not a corner case either.** An entry that
//! has been `unlink`ed but not yet `release`d is a volume with some
//! blocks allocated and unreachable — precisely a leak, precisely what
//! this module's write-order rules already produce for free under an
//! interrupted `delete`, and precisely as legal. It is not a transient
//! phase this module hides:
//!
//! - **It is ordinary, persistent, on-disk data.** Nothing marks it
//!   "in progress"; there is no session-local flag anywhere for it,
//!   because there does not need to be one. A `Mutator` that opens the
//!   volume fresh in a later process, on a different day, sees exactly
//!   the same allocated-but-unreachable chain an interrupted `delete`
//!   would have left, and can `release` it just the same. The handle
//!   [`Mutator::unlink`] hands back is simply an LBA — it survives a
//!   restart the same way the rest of the volume does.
//! - **[`validate`](crate::Volume::validate) classifies it as exactly
//!   [`Finding::OrphanBlock`](crate::Finding::OrphanBlock), one per
//!   block, and nothing else.** That is the same finding an interrupted
//!   `delete` produces, for the same reason: the walk reaches the volume
//!   from the root, and an unlinked header's whole chain is, by
//!   definition, not reached from anywhere. `tests/volumes.rs` pins this
//!   exactly — an unlinked file validates with one `OrphanBlock` per
//!   block it owns and no other finding, the rest of the volume
//!   unaffected.
//! - **[`repair`](crate::repair) treats it exactly as it treats any other
//!   leak: it stays allocated.** `repair`'s bitmap rebuild is defined as
//!   the *union* of the reachability walk and the bitmap's own existing
//!   bits (its own module documentation, "Repair only ever adds
//!   allocation and only ever removes reachability") — an orphan is
//!   already marked allocated, the walk does not reach it to add
//!   anything, and the union keeps it exactly as it was. That is the
//!   conservative direction on purpose: a walk over a *damaged* volume
//!   might miss a subtree that is not actually a leak, so freeing
//!   anything the walk failed to reach is unsafe in general, and `repair`
//!   never does it. The consequence worth stating plainly: **calling
//!   `repair` does not release an unlinked file's blocks.** A crash (or a
//!   process exit) between `unlink` and `release` leaves those blocks
//!   leaked until something calls `release` on that header LBA, or until
//!   whatever higher-level bookkeeping tracks open handles decides the
//!   file is orphaned and releases it during recovery — `repair`'s job is
//!   restoring a *bitmap* that agrees with the volume, not deciding which
//!   leaks are safe to reclaim, and an unlinked-but-still-referenced
//!   handle looks, from inside this crate, exactly like every other leak
//!   it is conservative about.
//!
//! `release` does not trust that the caller only ever offers it a header
//! `unlink` actually produced: it re-verifies reachability itself before
//! freeing anything (a name-hash lookup in the header's own recorded
//! parent, not a whole-volume walk — see [`Mutator::release`]'s own
//! documentation for why that is enough), and refuses with a typed error
//! rather than silently doing nothing when it is not warranted. Freeing a
//! block something still reaches is the one mistake this crate exists to
//! never make, and `release` is the one entry point whose entire job is
//! freeing blocks a caller has *asserted*, not derived, are unreachable.
//!
//! # File contents: the one place two blocks change together
//!
//! [`Mutator::write_file`], [`Mutator::append`] and [`Mutator::truncate`]
//! are the operations the three rules above do not fully cover, because a
//! file's *length* and its *extent* are recorded in different blocks and
//! must agree: [`Volume::file_chain`](crate::Volume::file_chain) refuses a
//! header whose `byte_size` and data-block count disagree, in both
//! directions, so any order that moves one before the other leaves a file
//! that will not read. Three decisions make that go away.
//!
//! **The file header block is the single commit.** Every size change ends
//! in exactly one write — the header, carrying `byte_size`, `high_seq`,
//! the whole data-pointer table and the extension pointer together. Before
//! that write the file is entirely the old one; after it, entirely the new
//! one.
//!
//! **The extension chain is immutable: it is rebuilt, never patched.**
//! That falls out of the previous rule rather than being a taste. A
//! `T_LIST` block is reachable only through the block before it, back to
//! the header, so *editing* one in place would commit a new block count
//! from a block that is not the header — and the header's `byte_size` would
//! still be the old one, which is precisely the unreadable state. So a
//! size change allocates a fresh chain, writes it (last block first, so no
//! `next` ever names a block that is not there), points the header at it,
//! and frees the old blocks afterwards. It costs one block per ~35 KB of
//! OFS file per size change, which is the price of the commit being one
//! write; a caller appending a byte at a time to a large file should
//! buffer, and every entry point here takes a whole slice for that reason.
//!
//! **A data block whose recorded length changes is replaced, not
//! edited** — on OFS only, where the length *is* recorded (longword 3 of
//! the block's own header). Growing a file makes its old last block full
//! and shrinking makes some earlier block short, and either way that
//! block's `size` field has to move in step with the header's `byte_size`.
//! Writing the new content to a freshly allocated block and swapping the
//! pointer in the commit keeps that single-write property. On FFS there is
//! no such field — the last block's length is `byte_size` arithmetic and
//! nothing else — so the boundary block is written in place, and the bytes
//! it gains past the old end of file are unreachable until the commit
//! makes them part of the file.
//!
//! ## The caveat: an in-place overwrite is not crash-atomic
//!
//! Data blocks that are entirely inside both the old file and the new one
//! and keep their length are **overwritten in place**, with a
//! read-modify-write for a partial first or last block. That is the one
//! place this module's "old volume, new volume, or old volume plus leaks"
//! invariant weakens, and it weakens to exactly: **old bytes or new bytes,
//! independently per block**. It is inherent to overwriting rather than a
//! shortcut — the alternative is copy-on-writing every touched block,
//! which turns every overwrite into a reallocation and makes a file's
//! blocks migrate across the volume for no gain the format can express.
//! What still holds through it is everything structural: the block count,
//! `byte_size`, the pointer tables and the bitmap are untouched by an
//! overwrite, so an interrupted one leaves a file of the right length made
//! of some old and some new blocks, which reads, validates and can simply
//! be written again. `ReachableButFree` remains impossible.
//!
//! ## Writing past the end: the gap is zero-filled
//!
//! [`Mutator::write_file`] at an offset past the current end of file, and
//! [`Mutator::truncate`] to a larger size, both **allocate every block in
//! the gap and fill it with zeroes**. The format has no other option: a
//! file's pointer table is dense by construction — data block *n* is the
//! *n*th table slot, counted through the extension chain, and slot 0 is
//! the chain's terminator — so there is no encoding for a hole and nothing
//! to be sparse with.
//!
//! Which leaves *what the gap contains*, and AmigaDOS answers that
//! deliberately loosely. `Seek()` cannot create the situation at all:
//! "You cannot Seek() beyond the end of a file" (`dos.library/Seek`
//! autodoc), and `ACTION_SEEK` "shall fail with the error code
//! `ERROR_SEEK_ERROR`" for a position "beyond the end-of-file", leaving
//! the file pointer unaltered — so seek-past-EOF-then-write is not a
//! behaviour to be compatible with, it is a refusal. The only route to an
//! extended file is `SetFileSize()`, whose autodoc says "if the file is
//! extended, no values should be assumed for the new bytes" and
//! `ACTION_SET_FILE_SIZE`'s specification says outright that "unlike other
//! operating systems, AmigaDOS does not enforce zero-initialization of the
//! extended region". Both permitted answers exist in the wild: AROS's
//! `afs.handler` grows by calling `writeData` with a NULL buffer, which on
//! FFS does not write the newly allocated block *at all* and leaves
//! whatever was on the disk; Linux's `affs` zeroes, through
//! `cont_expand_zero` on FFS and `affs_extent_file_ofs`/`affs_getzeroblk`
//! on OFS.
//!
//! This crate zeroes, and the reason is not tidiness: the bytes a
//! freshly allocated block holds are a *deleted file's*, and handing them
//! back through a new file's length is an information leak that the
//! specification permits and nobody wants. Zero is also within what every
//! caller may assume, since the specification lets them assume nothing.
//!
//! # Dircaches: regenerated, never patched
//!
//! On `DOS\4`/`DOS\5` the affected directory's whole cache chain is
//! **rebuilt from its hash chains** after every create, delete, rename and
//! metadata change — blocks reused where the new chain is the same length
//! or shorter, allocated where it grew, freed where it shrank. Surgical
//! editing of one record would be less I/O and one more place to leave the
//! cache disagreeing with the chains; regeneration cannot, because the
//! chains are the input. PLAN's rule for this milestone is "update or
//! clear, never leave stale", and after every operation here
//! [`validate`](crate::Volume::validate) reports zero
//! [`DircacheStale`](crate::Finding::DircacheStale) findings.
//!
//! The chain is written **backwards**, last block first, so a cache block
//! is on the disk before the pointer naming it is — the same rule as
//! everywhere else. A crash mid-regeneration leaves a cache that is stale,
//! which is what a cache written by any of the many tools that do not know
//! about `DOS\4` leaves too, and what `validate` reports and a rebuild
//! fixes.
//!
//! # Dates: yes, the parent is stamped — when there is a clock to stamp
//! it with
//!
//! The question "does creating a file touch its *parent's* DateStamp"
//! has an answer on real volumes, and it took reading four
//! implementations to be sure of it:
//!
//! - **amitools' `xdftool`** (the oracle this crate's tests run against)
//!   stamps both, on every create and every delete:
//!   `ADFSDir._create_node` and `_delete` each end in
//!   `update_dir_mod_time()` — the parent's longword −23 — followed by
//!   `volume.update_disk_time()` — the root's longword −10.
//! - **Linux `affs`** stamps the parent too:
//!   `affs_insert_hash` and `affs_remove_hash` (`fs/affs/amigaffs.c`)
//!   both end with `inode_set_mtime_to_ts(dir, …); mark_inode_dirty(dir)`,
//!   which `affs_write_inode` writes to `tail->change` (−23) or, for the
//!   root, `root_change` (also −23). It does *not* stamp the root's −10
//!   per operation: that happens in `affs_commit_super`, on sync and
//!   unmount.
//! - **ADFlib** stamps the parent in `adfCreateEntry` only when the new
//!   entry becomes a hash slot's head (the collision path forgets), and
//!   `adfRemoveEntry` never stamps at all — an inconsistency, not a
//!   convention.
//! - **AROS's `afs.handler`** does not stamp on create or delete, and
//!   stamps *every ancestor up to the root* on a write.
//!
//! So the rule implemented here is amitools': **the parent directory's
//! own DateStamp and the root's `disk_altered` (−10), on every create,
//! delete and rename**; the format date (−7) is left alone forever. When
//! the parent *is* the root, its DateStamp is the root's `dir_altered`,
//! which is the same longword −23 an entry uses.
//!
//! [`Mutator::set_metadata`] stamps neither, on the same authority: what
//! changed is the entry, not the directory's contents, and `xdftool
//! protect` writes the entry's block and nothing else. The entry's own
//! date is the caller's, through [`MetaUpdate::date`].
//!
//! The catch is that this crate is `no_std` and has no clock, so it
//! cannot invent a "now". [`Mutator::clock`] supplies one, and **until it
//! is set no date is written at all** — a deliberate refusal to put a
//! wrong date on the disk rather than a decision not to keep dates. Under
//! `std`, `populate::datestamp_from_system_time(SystemTime::now())` is
//! the one line that supplies it.
//!
//! [`AllocError::BitmapInvalid`]: crate::AllocError::BitmapInvalid
//!
//! # Block layout policy: passive reorganisation
//!
//! Wave 3 of PLAN.md's "Block layout policy, and compaction" entry.
//! Waves 1 and 2 gave the allocator an [`Intent`] vocabulary and gave
//! [`Mutator`] the primitives to *retroactively* fix a volume's layout
//! (`crate::compact`'s `defragment_file`/`relocate_header`) — both driven
//! by hand, or by [`Mutator::compact`]. This wave spends none of that on
//! a separate pass: it changes what [`Mutator`]'s own everyday writes do
//! with the blocks they were already going to allocate, so a volume gets
//! a little better every time something writes to it rather than only
//! when a defragmenter is run.
//!
//! Aminet's `PFS2DefragTry` (credited in PLAN.md) defragments by copying
//! a file out and back, trusting the filesystem to lay it down afresh —
//! which works on PFS2/AFS because *their* allocators seek contiguous
//! runs, and does not transfer to stock FFS, whose allocator is a bare
//! next-fit rover with no such intent (`docs/layout-survey.md` §4). But
//! this crate *is* the writer whenever [`Mutator`] is the one mutating,
//! and it chooses placement rather than hoping — so [`Mutator::write_file`]
//! recognises the copy-out-copy-back shape (a write that replaces a
//! file's entire content) and lands the replacement as one run when the
//! volume has room for it, which is the PFS2DefragTry trick working
//! *through* FFS for the first time. See `Mutator::edit_file`'s
//! `full_rewrite` for where that is decided, and
//! `tests/volumes.rs`'s `pfs2defragtry_pattern_yields_one_run` for the
//! closed loop.
//!
//! Three changes, all gated by [`Mutator::layout_policy`] (on by
//! default):
//!
//! 1. [`Mutator::create_file`] allocates its data-and-extension sequence
//!    as one [`Allocator::allocate_run`] instead of one block at a time —
//!    a new file is born as one run whenever a run exists, not merely
//!    "usually contiguous by accident of an ascending hint," which is all
//!    the pre-wave-3 per-block loop guaranteed.
//! 2. [`Mutator::create_dir`]'s `T_DIRCACHE` block places itself with
//!    [`Intent::MetadataNearRoot`] instead of next to its own header,
//!    matching wave 1's finding that dircache blocks belong near the
//!    root, not near the directory they describe.
//! 3. `Mutator::edit_file` (the private body behind
//!    [`Mutator::write_file`], [`Mutator::append`] and
//!    [`Mutator::truncate`]) places genuinely fresh blocks — growth, or
//!    every block of a full-content rewrite — with [`Intent::DataFor`];
//!    a small append still extends near the file's own last block
//!    (`Intent::DataFor`'s own hint), unchanged from before this wave,
//!    because passive means the caller's operation dictates the work and
//!    only *where* it lands is this wave's business.
//!
//! Turning the policy off reproduces the exact pre-wave-3 allocation
//! sequence — every hint this module used before this wave still exists,
//! just gated — for a caller that wants byte-predictable placement: a
//! differential comparison, or a test asserting an exact LBA as a proxy
//! for something the test actually cares about.

    ///   that handle it at all *do not agree on what the volume looks
    ///   like afterwards*:
    ///
    ///   - **AmigaOS** promotes. Its own documentation is explicit: "if
    ///     the object a hard link points to is deleted, then the first
    ///     hard link in the chain is altered so that it becomes the new
    ///     file header block. The original file header block is then

    ///     which invalidates every cached block pointer to it — including
    ///     the `parent` longword in every child of a promoted directory.
    ///   - **Linux `affs`** does the opposite, and says why in a comment:
    ///     "we can't remove the head of the link, as its blocknr is still
    ///     used as ino, so we remove the block of the first link
    ///     instead" (`affs_remove_link`, `fs/affs/amigaffs.c`). It keeps
    ///     the original block, `memcpy`s the *link's* 32-byte name into
    ///     it, `affs_insert_hash`es it into the **link's** directory, and
    ///     frees the link's block. The file survives — under a different
    ///     name, in a different directory from the one it was deleted
    ///     from.
    ///   - **ADFlib** refuses links outright (`adfRemoveEntry`:
    ///     "secType %d not supported"), **amitools** has no hard-link
    ///     code at all, and **AROS's `afs.handler`** defines
