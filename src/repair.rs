//! `repair()`: the write-side half of [`validate`](crate::validate).
//!
//! What the ROM's disk-validator does, and what has to happen before a
//! volume whose `bitmap_flag` is 0 can be allocated from again: walk the
//! tree, work out what is really in use, write a fresh bitmap describing
//! it, and stamp the flag valid last.
//!
//! # One direction, always
//!
//! The invariant this module is built around, and the one its tests
//! assert: **a repair only ever adds allocation, and only ever removes
//! reachability.** Those are the two directions
//! [`validate`](crate::validate) already distinguishes, and taking each
//! only one way means a repaired volume can be worse than a healthy one
//! but never worse than the damaged one it started as.
//!
//! - A block the walk reaches that the bitmap called free
//!   ([`Finding::ReachableButFree`](crate::Finding::ReachableButFree)) is
//!   marked **allocated**. That is the dangerous finding, and this is the
//!   whole point of the operation.
//! - A block the bitmap calls allocated that the walk did *not* reach
//!   ([`Finding::OrphanBlock`](crate::Finding::OrphanBlock)) stays
//!   allocated. The new bitmap is the **union** of the walk and the old
//!   bits, not the walk alone.
//!
//! That second decision is the one worth defending, because the ROM
//! validator frees orphans and this does not. Freeing a block the walk
//! failed to reach is only safe if the walk was complete — and a walk
//! over a damaged volume is precisely the case where it is not: one
//! unreadable directory block hides its entire subtree, and every file in
//! it looks exactly like a leak. Handing those blocks back is how a
//! recoverable volume becomes an unrecoverable one on the next write. So
//! orphans are reported ([`Action::LeakKept`]) and kept; reclaiming them
//! is a separate operation for a volume that validates clean apart from
//! the leaks, and it is not this one.
//!
//! The same reasoning is why an invalid bitmap is still *read*. Its bits
//! cannot be believed when they say "free" — that is what the flag means
//! — but a bit saying "allocated" is either true or a leak, and taking it
//! at its word is the conservative direction in both cases.
//!
//! # Severing, and what counts as proof
//!
//! Rebuilding the bitmap does not fix a corrupt hash chain: the entries
//! past the corruption are unreachable, so their blocks are (correctly)
//! kept as leaks and the directory keeps producing the same finding
//! forever. [`RepairOptions::sever`] opts in to cutting the damage out —
//! truncating a chain at its last good link, zeroing a comment pointer
//! that leads nowhere — and it is **off by default** because severing
//! throws away the only record of where those entries were. A recovery
//! tool wants to see the dangling pointer; a filesystem that has to mount
//! wants it gone.
//!
//! What may be severed is deliberately narrow: only what the ordinary
//! reader has *proved* it cannot follow. A header block that will not
//! parse, and a chain that revisits a block, are proof; an entry that
//! parses and merely disagrees with its parent is not, and is left alone
//! for a human. Nothing is severed that would drop a readable entry.
//!
//! # Order of writes
//!
//! `bitmap_flag = 0` first, then the pages, then the extension blocks,
//! then the root's pointers, then `bitmap_flag = -1`. An interruption at
//! any point therefore leaves a volume that says "my bitmap is
//! mid-update" — which is the state it was already in if it needed
//! repairing, and an honest one if it did not.
