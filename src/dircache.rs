//! Directory cache blocks (`DOS\4`/`DOS\5`): read, reported, **not
//! believed**.
//!
//! A dircache block is a denormalised copy of a directory's listing —
//! every entry's block, size, protection, owner, date, type, name and
//! comment, packed end to end — so that `List` can print a directory
//! from one or two block reads instead of one read per entry. On a
//! floppy that is the difference between a directory listing taking a
//! second and taking twenty.
//!
//! It is also a *cache*, with everything that implies. The hash chains
//! remain the filesystem's actual directory; the cache is a second
//! record of the same fact, written by whatever last modified the
//! directory. A filesystem that crashed between updating the chains and
//! updating the cache leaves them disagreeing, and every mutation done by
//! a tool that does not know about `DOS\4` (there are several) leaves
//! them disagreeing permanently.
//!
//! So this module reads the cache and hands it back marked advisory.
//! Nothing in this crate *resolves* a name through it, and
//! [`Volume::validate`](crate::validate) compares it against the chains
//! and reports the differences as findings. A reader that trusts a stale
//! cache invents a directory that isn't there — files that were deleted
//! still listed, files that were created still invisible — and does it
//! silently, which is worse than being slow.
//!
//! # Where the pointer lives
//!
//! Longword −2, [`TL_EXTENSION`] — the same field a *file* header uses
//! for its first `T_LIST` extension block. They cannot collide: the
//! field's meaning follows the block's secondary type, and a directory
//! has no data chain while a file has no directory to cache. The root's
//! copy is [`RootBlock::dircache`](crate::read::RootBlock::dircache),
//! read from the same longword.
//!
//! # The record layout
//!
//! Transcribed from ADFlib's `bDirCacheBlock`/dircache-entry structures
//! and confirmed byte for byte against `DOS\5` images built by xdftool:
//! six longwords of head (type 33, own key, the parent directory, the
//! record count, the next cache block, the checksum at the usual
//! longword 5), then packed records from byte 24. Each record is
//!
//! ```text
//!   0  entry block   long     8  protection  long    16  days   word
//!   4  size          long    12  UID         word    18  mins   word
//!                            14  GID         word    20  ticks  word
//!  22  secondary type  signed byte
//!  23  name length     byte      24            name
//!  24+name_len  comment length byte, then the comment
//! ```
//!
//! …rounded **up to an even length**, because the fields inside are
//! words. Two facts here are easy to get wrong and both are checked in
//! [`crate::layout`]'s tests: the `DateStamp` is three *words* rather than
//! three longwords (so a dircache date runs out in 2157 where a header
//! block's runs out in 11.7 million), and the padding is what makes the
//! record offsets 24, 54, 82 come out of names of 4, 2 and 6 characters.
