//! Compaction and defragmentation: the block-layout policy
//! (`docs/layout-survey.md`, `src/allocator.rs`'s "Block layout policy"
//! section, `src/populate.rs`'s own documentation) applied *retroactively*
//! to a volume that already exists, and the primitive `resize()` needs to
//! close its own known gap. Wave 2 of the PLAN.md "Block layout policy,
//! and compaction" entry; wave 1 was policy at creation time only.
//!
//! # Two tiers, and why they cost so differently
//!
//! **Tier 1** ([`Mutator::defragment_file`]) relocates a file's data
//! blocks — and its `T_LIST` extension blocks, which the survey's own
//! measurement (§4a's wave-1 addendum) puts *in* the stream, not near the
//! header — into one ascending run, without moving the header. **Tier 2**
//! ([`Mutator::relocate_header`]) moves a directory or file *header* block
//! itself to a new LBA, which is the survey's §6b-3 recommendation and the
//! operation `docs/layout-survey.md` names as "where the bugs would
//! live" — because unlike tier 1, which only ever changes what a header's
//! *own* table points at, tier 2 changes the header's own number, and
//! *everything* that names a block by number has to follow it.
//!
//! # Tier 1's atomicity: one commit, like `edit_file`
//!
//! A file's data blocks are read-only from the header's point of view
//! until the very last write. This mirrors [`Mutator`]'s existing
//! `edit_file` shape exactly, deliberately: allocate the whole destination
//! run first ([`crate::Allocator::allocate_run`]), write every data and extension
//! block at its new home (extension blocks written last-block-first, so no
//! `next` ever names a block that is not there yet), then **one** header
//! write that swaps the table and the extension pointer over — before that
//! write the file is entirely the old one, after it entirely the new one —
//! then free the old blocks. `bitmap_flag` never leaves −1: every
//! intermediate state is exactly the ordinary [`Mutator`] guarantee ("the
//! old volume, the new volume, or the old volume plus leaked blocks"), the
//! same one `edit_file` already gives a resize in miniature, applied to
//! block *position* instead of file *length*. This is strictly better than
//! the bar `docs/layout-survey.md` §1 sets: ReOrg's own author documents a
//! "moving blocks... must not be interrupted" phase with an explicit
//! backup warning; this crate has no such phase, in either tier.
//!
//! # Tier 2's atomicity: everything hard-checked gets a fresh copy first
//!
//! The naive approach — patch a dependent block's owner field in place to
//! point at the header's *new* number — cannot be made atomic, because the
//! block being patched is *shared*: whichever pointer is currently
//! authoritative (the parent's hash slot, naming either the old or the new
//! header number) determines which value that dependent's owner field
//! must already hold for an ordinary read to succeed, and a single block
//! cannot hold both values at once. [`crate::Volume::file_chain`]'s
//! `T_LIST`-block parent check, OFS's `verify_ofs_data` header-key check
//! and [`crate::Volume::comment`]'s comment-block header-key check are all *hard*
//! read errors (unlike a directory child's `parent` longword, which
//! [`crate::resize`]'s own root-move already leaves briefly stale and
//! which only [`Finding::ParentMismatch`](crate::Finding::ParentMismatch)
//! reports) — so patching them in place, whichever side of the commit it
//! happens on, leaves a window in which a crash makes the file
//! unreadable through the *currently authoritative* header number.
//!
//! So tier 2 does not patch in place. Every hard-checked dependent — a
//! file's extension blocks (both variants: [`crate::Finding`] aside, the parent
//! check in [`crate::Volume::file_chain`] is unconditional), a directory's own
//! dircache chain, an LNFS overflow comment block, and — the cost worth
//! documenting plainly — **every OFS data block**, because
//! `verify_ofs_data` checks `header_key` on every one of them — gets a
//! **fresh copy** at a new LBA, built with the new header number already
//! in it, before the header itself is copied to its new LBA and before
//! anything points at any of it. Only then does a single write retarget
//! whichever pointer currently names the header (the parent's hash slot,
//! or the previous entry's hash-chain longword — found and replaced the
//! way [`Mutator`]'s private `unlink` walk finds a splice point, except
//! this write substitutes rather than removes) — and from the instant
//! that lands, the header's new number is *immediately* fully self-
//! consistent, because every dependent it can reach already agrees with
//! it. Soft-checked follow-up (a moved directory's direct children,
//! [`crate::Entry::real_entry`] in every hard link naming a moved target, the
//! parent's own dircache record) happens after, on the same "safe either
//! order" basis [`crate::resize`]'s reparenting already relies on.
//!
//! **The cost, stated plainly, per the survey's own instruction not to
//! bury the number a reader would want:** on FFS, relocating a file's
//! header costs its extension blocks only — the data blocks have no
//! back-pointer to a header at all, so they never move. On OFS, it costs
//! **every data block**, because `header_key` is real and enforced.
//! Relocating a header therefore is not cheap on OFS the way tier 1 is;
//! callers that want directory-header locality without that cost should
//! prefer running tier 1 alone, which is most of the measured benefit
//! (`docs/layout-survey.md` §1, ReOrg's own author's finding, restated in
//! `src/allocator.rs`) for a fraction of tier 2's price.
//!
//! `bitmap_flag` is **not** honest throughout a tier-2 relocation, on
//! purpose: it is forced to 0 for the whole operation, the same choice
//! [`crate::resize`]'s root move and [`crate::populate::Populator`] both
//! already make, and for the same reason — the operation is not a single
//! block write, so there is no single instant to point `Allocator::load`
//! at as "trustworthy," and honestly saying so is better than a bitmap
//! that is only sometimes describable as either "old" or "new." A crash
//! mid-operation leaves the bitmap flagged invalid; [`crate::Volume::repair`]
//! (which never removes reachability, only adds it) always restores a
//! valid bitmap, and — because every hard-checked dependent was staged
//! *before* the commit rather than patched in place — a **retry** of the
//! same relocation (looked up by name, since the header's number may or
//! may not have already changed) always finishes whatever was left
//! half-done, exactly [`crate::resize`]'s own documented "Retrying"
//! contract, generalized from "the root" to "any header." See this
//! module's crash-sweep tests for the two paths pinned: `repair()` alone
//! never leaves `ReachableButFree` and never leaves a corrupt-but-
//! unreachable block un-repairable; `repair()` **then a retry** always
//! reaches a clean, byte-identical volume.
//!
//! # `make_room`: the primitive `resize()`'s shrink actually needs
//!
//! [`Mutator::make_room`] evacuates every *movable* allocated block out of
//! a caller-given LBA range: a header found there is relocated (tier 2);
//! a file's data or extension block found there relocates the *whole*
//! file (tier 1, since a file's data blocks are one unit once any of them
//! has to move); a dircache or comment block found there relocates its
//! *owning* header (tier 2), which — per this module's own design above —
//! always gives that block a fresh copy elsewhere as a side effect. The
//! root, the bitmap's own pages and its extension blocks are **not**
//! movable by this operation — [`crate::resize`] already knows how to
//! relocate exactly those three kinds of block as part of a shrink, and
//! duplicating that here would be two implementations of one piece of
//! reasoning. This is precisely the complement of
//! [`crate::resize`]'s own `movable_metadata`: that function names what a
//! shrink's cut may pass through *without* relocating anything;
//! `make_room` is what relocates everything else out of the way first.
//!
//! # Wiring into `resize`
//!
//! [`crate::resize::ResizeError::RootTargetOccupied`] fires when a
//! shrink's new root midpoint lands on a block resize does not relocate.
//! [`crate::Volume::resize_evacuating`] is a separate, explicitly
//! opt-in method (not a flag on [`crate::Volume::resize`] itself —
//! see its own documentation for why the plain refusal stays what
//! `resize` does by default) that retries the shrink once after an
//! internal `make_room` of the target block.
//! [`crate::Volume::minimum_size_floor`] reports the size a shrink could
//! reach *if* it were willing to relocate user data out of the root's
//! path — the number `docs/layout-survey.md` and PLAN.md both call "the
//! theoretical floor" — alongside the existing, more conservative
//! [`crate::Volume::minimum_size`].
//!
//! # What is deliberately out of scope
//!
//! Full-volume policy compaction ([`Mutator::compact`]) runs tier 1 across
//! every file by default; tier 2 (header clustering toward the root) is
//! opt-in via [`CompactOptions::relocate_headers`], off by default. This
//! is a considered scoping choice, not an oversight: tier 1 alone is most
//! of the measured benefit (the survey's own ReOrg citation and this
//! crate's frag-bench rig agree), tier 2's OFS cost is real, and a
//! default that quietly rewrites every directory header on every compact
//! is a bigger blast radius than a defragmentation pass should have by
//! default. Callers that want full metadata clustering opt in explicitly,
//! or call [`Mutator::relocate_header`] directly, entry by entry.
