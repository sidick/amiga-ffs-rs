//! Creating a volume: the boot block, the root block and the bitmap that
//! together make a run of blocks a mountable, empty filesystem.
//!
//! What `Format` does, minus the icon. [`format`](format()) writes the
//! smallest set of blocks that constitutes a valid volume of any of the
//! eight variants at any block size, and nothing else: the blocks it does
//! not write are marked free and left exactly as they were. Formatting a
//! 2 GB image therefore touches a few hundred blocks, not four million,
//! which is also what the real thing does — a `Format` that zeroed the
//! medium would take all afternoon and buy nothing, because a free block
//! is never read.
//!
//! # Where everything goes, and how that was decided
//!
//! The root is at [`canonical_root_lba`] — recomputed from geometry on
//! every mount, so it is not a choice so much as an arithmetic result.
//! Everything else *is* a choice, and each one below was made by
//! formatting an image with xdftool (amitools, GPL — run as an oracle,
//! never copied) and reading the bytes back out:
//!
//! - **Bitmap pages sit immediately after the root**, contiguous and
//!   ascending. A `DOS\1` ADF xdftool formats has its single page at 881
//!   with the root at 880; a 10 MB image has its six pages at 10241..10246
//!   with the root at 10240.
//! - **Bitmap extension blocks come *before* the pages**, filling the
//!   gap between the root and the first page. A 400 MB image (819 200
//!   blocks, 202 pages needed) puts extension blocks at root+1 and root+2,
//!   the root's own 25 page pointers at root+3..root+27, and the remaining
//!   177 pages after them — the first extension block holding 127 and the
//!   second the last 50. This crate lays down the identical shape.
//! - **`DOS\4`/`DOS\5` roots get a dircache block at birth.** A freshly
//!   formatted `DOS\5` ADF carries a `T_DIRCACHE` block with zero records
//!   whose parent is the root, and the root's longword −2 points at it.
//!   An empty root on a dircache volume is *not* one with a null pointer.
//!   Its *position* is where this crate diverges: xdftool's allocator
//!   returns the lowest free bit of the bitmap longword the root falls in
//!   (866 for a root at 880; root−30 for the two larger images), which is
//!   an artefact of how that allocator scans and not a property of the
//!   format. This crate puts it in the next block after the last bitmap
//!   page, which is contiguous, deterministic, and the same rule the
//!   bitmap blocks follow.
//!
//! # The boot block, and the checksum that is deliberately not written
//!
//! Block 0 gets the dostype in longword 0 and the root block's LBA in
//! longword 2, as xdftool writes it and as `struct BootBlock` defines it.
//! Longword 1 — the checksum — is left **zero** unless
//! [`FormatOptions::boot_checksum`] says otherwise, and that default is
//! the interesting decision. A zero checksum does not fail to be valid by
//! accident: it is what makes the boot block *non-bootable*, and a
//! non-bootable boot block is what `Format` produces (`Install` is the
//! separate command that writes boot code and a checksum over it). A boot
//! block whose checksum passes and whose code is 1012 zero bytes is
//! strictly worse than one that fails: the ROM would accept it and jump
//! into the zeroes. xdftool leaves it zero too. The option exists because
//! a caller writing its own boot code needs the checksum
//! ([`bootblock_checksum`](crate::bootblock_checksum())) applied to the
//! result, and it is documented as the footgun it is.
//!
//! The boot *area* is 1024 bytes — two 512-byte sectors, which is what
//! the ROM reads, a fixed count that has nothing to do with the
//! filesystem's block size. At 512-byte blocks it spans blocks 0 and 1;
//! at 1 KB and above it lives inside block 0 alone, and the remaining
//! reserved blocks are simply zeroed. No oracle was available for that
//! last claim — xdftool's images are 512-blocked and larger block sizes
//! live behind an RDB — so it is stated as the inference it is. Nothing
//! reads past 1024 bytes for a checksum this crate leaves at zero anyway.
//!
//! # Order of writes
//!
//! Bitmap pages and extension blocks first, then the dircache, then the
//! root, then the boot block. An interruption therefore leaves a volume
//! that does not mount, rather than one that mounts with a root pointing
//! at blocks that were never written — the same failure direction
//! milestone 3's mutation ordering exists to preserve.
