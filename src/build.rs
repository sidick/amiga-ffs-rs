//! Block assembly: the bytes of an entry, with no medium in sight.
//!
//! Two writers in this crate lay down the same blocks for two different
//! reasons. [`Populator`](crate::Populator) fills a volume it just
//! formatted, allocating with a cursor over a known-free extent;
//! [`Mutator`](crate::Mutator) changes a volume somebody else wrote,
//! allocating from its bitmap under the mark-then-use ordering. What they
//! do *differently* is which block goes where and in what order; what they
//! must do **identically** is what a header block, a comment block, a data
//! block and a dircache record contain — and a second copy of that would
//! be a second chance to put the LNFS comment at the classic offset, which
//! is the one mistake this crate exists to not make.
//!
//! So the assembly lives here, as pure functions over a `&mut [u8]` that
//! is already the block's size. Nothing in this module reads or writes a
//! medium, allocates a block, or decides what is free: every function
//! takes the numbers it needs and fills in bytes. That is also what makes
//! it testable without a disk — the layout tests in [`crate::layout`] check
//! the offsets, and these functions are the only place those offsets are
//! turned into a block.
