//! Block allocation against a volume that already has something in it.
//!
//! [`Populator`](crate::Populator) allocates with a cursor over a *known*
//! free extent and never asks the disk whether a block is free. This
//! module is where that question finally gets asked, and where the answer
//! has to be right: an allocator over an existing volume hands out blocks
//! that other files' metadata is pointing at, and getting it wrong once
//! means two owners for one block and a file that reads as somebody else's
//! bytes.
//!
//! # The policy, and what the real thing does
//!
//! Implemented here: **first fit from a hint, forward, wrapping once**.
//! [`Allocator::allocate_near`] takes a hint LBA, converts it to a bit
//! index, scans upward a longword at a time to the end of the bitmap's
//! coverage, and then wraps to the volume's first allocatable block and
//! scans up to the hint. [`Allocator::allocate`] uses the block after the
//! last one handed out — a rotating cursor — so a caller with no opinion
//! still gets ascending, locally contiguous runs rather than a rescan of
//! the same full region on every call.
//!
//! That is behaviourally what the shipping implementations do, as far as
//! they can be observed:
//!
//! - **Linux `affs`** (`fs/affs/bitmap.c`, GPL — read to describe, never
//!   copied) takes a *goal* block from the caller, defaulting to the
//!   volume's first allocatable block, scans forward within the goal's
//!   bitmap page, moves on to the next page when that one is full, and
//!   wraps to page zero before giving up. It additionally *pre-allocates*
//!   a run of consecutive free bits within the goal's longword and hands
//!   them out one at a time to the same inode. That last part is a
//!   performance trick with no on-disk consequence, and this crate does
//!   not do it: a run handed out but not used would have to be given back
//!   or leaked, and the mark-then-use ordering below is easier to state
//!   when one call marks exactly one block.
//! - **amitools' `xdftool`** (an oracle, run and never copied) scans from
//!   the *bottom* of the bitmap every time: on a `DOS\1` ADF it filled
//!   866..902 for three files, and after deleting the middle one and
//!   writing another it filled the freed 873..879 and 882..883 before
//!   touching anything higher. First fit, with the hint pinned to zero.
//!
//! Any of these is *correct*; the differences are locality, not
//! semantics, and nothing on disk records which was used. What must hold,
//! and what this module's tests assert, is only ever the same three
//! things: never hand out a block the bitmap says is allocated, never hand
//! out the same block twice, and never hand out a block outside
//! `reserved..block_count`.
//!
//! # Mark-then-use, and how the API makes it hard to get backwards
//!
//! The format has no journal, so ordering is the whole of crash safety,
//! and the two directions are not equally bad. A block that is marked
//! allocated and reached by nothing is a **leak**
//! ([`Finding::OrphanBlock`](crate::Finding::OrphanBlock)) — space lost
//! until a validator rebuilds the bitmap, and harmless meanwhile. A block
//! that something reaches while the bitmap says free is a **pending
//! double-allocation**
//! ([`Finding::ReachableButFree`](crate::Finding::ReachableButFree)) — the
//! next allocation hands it to a second owner, and then one of the two
//! files is silently wrong. So:
//!
//! - **Allocating**: mark the bitmap, get the mark to the disk, and only
//!   then write the metadata that points at the block. Crash anywhere in
//!   that order and the worst case is a leak.
//! - **Freeing**: unlink in the metadata first, get *that* to the disk,
//!   and only then clear the bit. Crash anywhere in that order and the
//!   worst case is, again, a leak.
//!
//! Documentation alone would not make the first of those hard to get
//! wrong, so it is in the types. [`Allocator::allocate`] returns an
//! [`Allocation`], not a block number. [`Allocation::block`] gives the LBA
//! to *write the block's own contents at* — always safe, because nothing
//! references it yet — while [`Allocator::reference`] gives the LBA that
//! may be stored in somebody else's pointer, and **refuses**
//! ([`AllocError::NotDurable`]) while the bitmap page holding the bit is
//! still only marked in memory. Between them sits [`Allocator::flush`],
//! which writes the dirty pages and nothing else.
//!
//! Freeing cannot be enforced the same way — this module cannot see the
//! caller's metadata write — so [`Allocator::free`] is documented as the
//! second half of an unlink and refuses the one error it *can* see: a
//! double free ([`AllocError::DoubleFree`]), which is a block already
//! marked free being freed again, and the shape a retried delete takes.
//!
//! # Dirty pages
//!
//! Edits accumulate in memory, one dirty flag per bitmap page, and
//! [`Allocator::flush`] writes only the pages that changed — a session
//! that allocates twenty blocks out of one region writes one block, not
//! twenty. Each page is written with its checksum in longword **0**
//! ([`BITMAP_CHECKSUM_INDEX`]), the format's one exception, and a page's
//! dirty flag is cleared only after its write returns, so an interrupted
//! flush leaves the rest still queued rather than silently dropped.
//!
//! # An invalid bitmap is not an allocation source
//!
//! [`Allocator::load`] refuses a volume whose root says `bitmap_flag == 0`
//! ([`AllocError::BitmapInvalid`]). Those bits are whatever an interrupted
//! update left behind: a validator wants to see them (which is why
//! [`Bitmap`](crate::Bitmap) reads them anyway), and an allocator acting
//! on them would hand out blocks a file is using. Rebuilding is
//! [`repair`](crate::repair)'s job, and it is the one caller here that
//! constructs an allocator from a set it computed itself
//! ([`Allocator::rebuilt`]) rather than from the disk.
//!
//! # Block layout policy
//!
//! `docs/layout-survey.md` (in the repository, not published with the
//! crate) is the evidence base for everything below; citations here are to
//! its section numbers. The policy is stated here, once, because
//! [`Intent`] is where a caller states *what kind* of block it is placing,
//! and the reasoning for why that vocabulary exists belongs next to it.
//!
//! **What goes where, and why.** ReOrg's own author judged directory- and
//! file-header *scatter*, not file-data fragmentation, the dominant
//! real-world cost on FFS/OFS (survey §1) — a conclusion this crate's own
//! measurement corroborates independently: laying one file's data as six
//! runs instead of one cost a real Kickstart 3.1 ROM 47% more wall-clock
//! time reading it off a floppy (survey §4a, `examples/frag-bench.rs`).
//! Two, not one, conclusions follow:
//!
//! - **Data contiguity is real and measured** — [`Intent::DataFor`] and
//!   [`Allocator::allocate_run`] exist so a caller can ask for (up to) a
//!   whole file's extent as one ascending run, rather than one block at a
//!   time from a hint that a colliding allocation could break.
//! - **Metadata locality is the *larger*, and evidence-independent-of-
//!   floppies, effect.** [`Intent::HeaderIn`] and [`Intent::MetadataNearRoot`]
//!   place headers, dircache blocks and comment overflow near a directory
//!   or the root because AROS's `getCacheBlock` — a hold-cache with no
//!   read-ahead, not a prefetch buffer (survey §2) — only pays off when the
//!   working set a directory walk touches is small and close together.
//!   That is a cache-*hit-rate* argument, not a seek argument, so unlike
//!   data contiguity it transfers unconditionally to CF/SD, where there is
//!   no seek cost to save at all (survey §3, the one row of the ranking
//!   table with a "full" mark in every column).
//!
//! Metadata locality does not, however, cover *every* block a file's
//! header reaches. `T_LIST` extension blocks were measured both ways
//! through the same real-ROM rig — clustered near the root with the
//! header, and interleaved into the data run at their natural stream
//! position — and interleaved won (19 s versus 21 s on the identical
//! 391-block file; see the addendum to survey §4a). An extension block
//! is fetched mid-stream, by a reader already reading the file, not once
//! at open the way a header is, so it is [`Intent::DataFor`]'s to place,
//! not [`Intent::HeaderIn`]'s — see [`Populator`](crate::Populator)'s own
//! documentation for the full reasoning.
//!
//! **What this deliberately does not do**, and why doing it would be
//! cargo-cult rather than policy (survey §3, §6a-4):
//!
//! - **No cylinder or track alignment derived from RDB geometry.** The
//!   RDB's `rdb_Cylinders`/`rdb_Heads`/`rdb_Sectors` fields are software-
//!   chosen to multiply out to the reported size on essentially every
//!   medium this crate targets, not tied to physical platters — AmigaOS's
//!   own RDB documentation says so. A real floppy's geometry (11
//!   sectors/track, 22 blocks/cylinder on DD) is a format constant that
//!   never needs reading from anywhere, and floppies do not carry an RDB
//!   to read it from regardless — but nothing here computes cylinder
//!   boundaries for a hard disk or CF/SD image, because there is nothing
//!   physical on the other end of that arithmetic.
//! - **No segregated allocation zones.** [`Intent`] reduces to a
//!   *hint and a preference*, resolved by the same first-fit scan
//!   [`Allocator::allocate_near`] already does — not a partition of the
//!   bitmap into a metadata region and a data region with their own
//!   accounting. A caller with an anchor (a directory's LBA, a file
//!   header's LBA) gets locality by scanning from that anchor; nothing
//!   here reserves address ranges in advance for a class of block, which
//!   would be exactly the fixed-geometry reasoning the previous point
//!   rejects, aimed at content instead of cylinders.
//! - **No free-space policy knob.** ReOrg exposed where a *compaction*
//!   pass leaves reclaimed free space as a user choice (survey §1); this
//!   module allocates blocks, and creation-time free space is simply
//!   "the rest of the bitmap" — a knob for where a compactor leaves its
//!   leftovers belongs to that later piece of work, not to allocation.
//!
//! [`Populator`](crate::Populator) implements the metadata/data split
//! `Intent` makes possible directly, with two independent forward cursors
//! rather than by calling into this module — see its own documentation for
//! why (it has no bitmap to scan a hint against mid-session, only a known
//! free extent and a monotonic frontier). [`Mutator`](crate::Mutator)'s own
//! adoption of `Intent` for its day-to-day writes, and a compaction pass
//! that applies the same policy retroactively, are later work; this module
//! only has to make the vocabulary and the primitives honest today.
