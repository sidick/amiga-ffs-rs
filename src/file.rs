//! File data, link resolution, and the comment that needed its own block.
//!
//! Three jobs that share one shape: follow a pointer off the disk to
//! another block, and refuse everything about it that does not add up.
//! They are here rather than in [`crate::read`] because they are the
//! second layer — everything below already works without them — and
//! because the verification each one does is the interesting part, not
//! the pointer-following.
//!
//! # The data-block chain
//!
//! A file header block's table (longword 6 onward, the same space a
//! directory uses for hashing) holds up to
//! [`hash_table_size`](crate::hash_table_size()) data-block pointers,
//! **filled from the end backwards**: the last slot is data block 1.
//! Longword 2, `high_seq`, says how many slots are used. When the table
//! fills, longword −2 points at a `T_LIST` extension block with the same
//! backward-filled table and its own `high_seq`, chained onward through
//! its own longword −2 until zero.
//!
//! At 512 bytes that is 72 pointers per block: ~36 KB of FFS data, ~35 KB
//! of OFS, before the first extension block appears. Which is why a file
//! test that never crosses one proves nothing about extension blocks.
//!
//! # OFS data blocks verify themselves
//!
//! FFS data blocks are raw payload: `block_size` bytes, no header, no
//! checksum, nothing to check them against except the arithmetic of
//! `byte_size`. OFS data blocks carry six longwords of header — type,
//! the owning file header's block, the sequence number, the payload
//! length, the next data block, a checksum — and every one of those is a
//! cross-check the format is *offering*. Taking it is the whole reason
//! OFS costs 24 bytes a block: a reader that ignores the headers pays the
//! space and declines the benefit.
//!
//! So this module checks all of them, and the mismatches are typed errors
//! rather than warnings. The one field deliberately *not* enforced is
//! `next` (longword 4): it duplicates the header's table, and the table
//! is what the filesystem allocates from, so where they disagree the
//! table is right. It is exposed rather than checked.
//!
//! # Ranged reads
//!
//! [`Volume::read_range`] is the other half of the read surface, and the
//! one a FUSE adapter or a trackdisk-level consumer actually wants: nobody
//! at that layer reads whole files. It touches **only the blocks the range
//! covers** — the first is `offset / payload_size`, which is arithmetic
//! rather than a walk — and verifies the OFS headers of exactly those,
//! because a block's expected sequence number falls out of its index and
//! not out of having walked there from block 1. That is what makes a
//! ranged read O(range) rather than O(file), and it is only true because
//! [`FileChain`] was split out of the streaming read in the first place: the
//! chain is collected once, and is immutable data a concurrent consumer can
//! hold outside its `Volume` lock.
