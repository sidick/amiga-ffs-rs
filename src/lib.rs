//! Amiga Fast File System (and its Old File System ancestor): pure
//! format logic for every `DOS\0`–`DOS\7` variant, including the
//! `DOS\6`/`DOS\7` long-filename layouts.
//!
//! This crate is the filesystem half of a deliberate split: partition
//! tables live in [`amiga-rdb`](https://github.com/sidick/amiga-rdb-rs),
//! one filesystem family per crate, composed by the consumer through a
//! block-device seam. Nothing here knows what an RDB is; a volume is
//! just a run of blocks.
//!
//! # The seam
//!
//! [`BlockSource`] carries four decisions, each made deliberately and
//! each confirmed by watching another crate choose differently and pay
//! for it:
//!
//! - `&mut self` — a device read is a mutation (seeks, caches, wear);
//!   `&self` just forces interior mutability onto every real backend.
//! - A typed error — "why did the read fail" is the first question a
//!   storage stack asks; `Result<(), ()>` cannot answer it.
//! - `u64` LBAs — 32-bit block arithmetic is how the platform's formats
//!   hit their 2 TB walls.
//! - **Runtime block size** — filesystem blocks are 512 bytes to 32 KB,
//!   *per volume*, on the same disk. A `[u8; 512]` in the trait
//!   signature is a wall built exactly where the format is flexible.
//!
//! # Status
//!
//! Primitives — DOS-type/variant model, block checksums (standard and
//! boot-block), BCPL strings, and the two name-hash functions with their
//! case-folding rules — plus the structural layers on top: [`layout`]
//! (every on-disk offset, for both the classic and the long-name name
//! layouts), [`read`] (boot block, root block, directory traversal),
//! [`mod@file`] (file data through FFS chains and OFS data blocks, hard-link
//! resolution, soft-link paths, overflow comment blocks), [`meta`]
//! (the protection longword's inverted-sense bits, and the `DateStamp`'s
//! calendar conversion), [`dircache`] (`DOS\4`/`DOS\5` cache blocks, read
//! and marked advisory), [`bitmap`] (the allocation bitmap, with its four
//! easily-inverted conventions stated), [`validate`] (the whole-volume
//! walk that reports rather than refuses), [`mod@format`] (creating a
//! volume: boot block, root and bitmap, every variant, every block size)
//! and [`populate`] (filling one: directories, files, metadata, and a
//! host directory tree under `std`).
//!
//! The primitives come first because they are where a subtle mistake —
//! the wrong `toupper` table, a hash off by the length byte, a name read
//! at the classic offset on a `DOS\7` volume — produces a filesystem that
//! *mostly* works. Everything above them is pointer-following, and every
//! pointer is range-checked and every chain refuses to revisit a block.
//!
//! Milestone 1 (read) is complete, and milestone 2's creation side with
//! it: [`BlockSink`] is the write seam (a second trait, not a bound on
//! [`BlockSource`] — read-only sources are the common case),
//! [`format`](format()) creates a fresh, empty, valid volume of any
//! variant at any block size, and [`Populator`] fills one — directories,
//! files, comments, dates, protection, every name layout, OFS and FFS
//! data blocks, extension blocks and `DOS\4`/`DOS\5` dircaches — with
//! `populate::populate_from_tree` turning a host directory into an image
//! in one call under the `std` feature. What is *not* here: **mutating**
//! a volume that already has something in it. Deleting, renaming,
//! truncating and appending are milestone 3, and [`Populator`] is
//! deliberately shaped so that it never has to do any of them.
