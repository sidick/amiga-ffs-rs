//! Filling a freshly formatted volume: directories, files, metadata.
//!
//! [`format`](crate::format()) leaves a mountable empty volume;
//! [`Populator`] is what puts something in it. Between them they are the
//! whole of "make me a disk image out of this directory" — the operation
//! Copperline wants for dynamic drives and amibake wants for `dir` → HDF
//! — and they are deliberately *not* the operation milestone 3 is about.
//!
//! # What this is not: the mutation boundary
//!
//! A [`Populator`] may only be pointed at a volume **this crate has just
//! formatted**, and it may only *add*. There is no delete, no rename, no
//! truncate, no second session over a volume somebody else wrote — those
//! are milestone 3, and they need the read-modify-write allocator
//! discipline (crash ordering, bitmap-before-metadata, freeing chains
//! without leaking them) that this module exists to avoid needing.
//!
//! The avoidance is the design. A populator is constructed from the
//! [`FormatLayout`] the format returned, so the set of blocks already in
//! use is *known*, not discovered; allocation is a cursor that walks
//! upward from the first free block and never revisits one; and the
//! bitmap is written **once**, at [`Populator::finish`], from that
//! cursor. Nothing here ever has to decide whether a block on disk is
//! free, so nothing here can get that decision wrong.
//!
//! # The crash shape
//!
//! Because the bitmap is not written until the end, a populator that is
//! interrupted leaves a volume whose bitmap says less is in use than
//! really is — the *dangerous* direction, the one
//! [`Finding::ReachableButFree`](crate::validate::Finding::ReachableButFree)
//! is about. So construction clears the root's `bitmap_flag` first: an
//! interrupted populate leaves a volume that says out loud "my bitmap is
//! mid-update, do not allocate from me" (which AmigaDOS's own validator
//! and this crate's [`Bitmap::valid`](crate::Bitmap::valid) both honour),
//! and [`Populator::finish`] sets it back to −1 as the last thing it
//! does, after the pages it describes are on the disk.
//!
//! Within one entry the ordering is the same one
//! [`format`](crate::format()) uses: content before metadata, and the
//! pointer that makes a block reachable written last. A file's data
//! blocks go down first, then its extension blocks, then its header, and
//! only then is the header chained into its parent's hash table. An
//! interruption at any point leaves blocks that nothing reaches — a leak,
//! and a leak is what a validator can fix.
//!
//! # Every variant, honestly
//!
//! - **Names** are checked per variant: 30 bytes on `DOS\0`–`DOS\5`, 107
//!   on `DOS\6`/`DOS\7`, Latin-1 throughout, no `:` or `/` and no control
//!   codes — the same rule [`format`](crate::format()) applies to a volume
//!   name, from the same function.
//! - **Comments** go beside the name in the classic layout, and into the
//!   LNFS `NaC` field when a long name leaves room for them. When it does
//!   not, a [`T_COMMENT`] block is allocated and longword −18 points at
//!   it — which is the state [`Volume::comment`](crate::Volume::comment)
//!   exists to resolve, and the state a writer that skipped it would
//!   silently truncate instead.
//! - **File data** is FFS raw blocks or OFS headered ones, with the
//!   header's backward-filled pointer table spilling into `T_LIST`
//!   extension blocks exactly when it fills.
//! - **Hash chains**: a new entry goes in at the **head** of its slot's
//!   chain, which is what the oracle does — three colliding names written
//!   in order to a `DOS\3` ADF by xdftool come back with the *last* one in
//!   the root's hash slot and the first at the end of the chain. Head
//!   insertion is also the only order that is O(1) and cannot walk a chain
//!   it is about to change.
//! - **Dircaches** (`DOS\4`/`DOS\5`) are maintained, not skipped. Every
//!   directory this module creates gets its own `T_DIRCACHE` block at
//!   birth (xdftool's do, and so does the root
//!   [`format`](crate::format()) writes), and every entry created gets a
//!   record appended to its parent's cache, spilling into a chained block
//!   when one fills. The one place this module does *more* than the
//!   oracle is the record's secondary-type byte, which xdftool leaves
//!   zero: filling it in is strictly more information and
//!   [`validate`](crate::Volume::validate) reads a zero there as "not
//!   recorded" either way.
//!
//! # Duplicates
//!
//! A name that already exists in the parent — under the *volume's* fold
//! table, so `Foo` and `FOO` are the same name on every variant and `café`
//! and `CAFÉ` are the same name on the intl ones — is refused. AmigaDOS
//! would happily create the second one and then be unable to open either
//! reliably; this refuses instead.
//!
//! # Block layout policy: two cursors, not one
//!
//! See `docs/layout-survey.md` §6a and [`crate::allocator`]'s own "Block
//! layout policy" section for the evidence; this is that policy's
//! implementation for a populator specifically, and it differs from
//! [`Allocator`](crate::Allocator)'s [`Intent`](crate::Intent)-driven one
//! because a populator has no bitmap to scan a hint against — only a
//! known-free extent and a cursor that never revisits a block. So instead
//! of resolving a hint per allocation, this module keeps **two** cursors
//! open for the whole session:
//!
//! - **The metadata cursor** starts at `format_span.1` — the block
//!   immediately after everything [`format`](crate::format()) wrote, which
//!   begins *at* the root — and serves every directory header, file
//!   header, dircache block and LNFS comment-overflow block. Every one of
//!   those is something a directory walk touches (survey §2's
//!   hold-cache argument), so starting right next to the root and never
//!   moving elsewhere keeps the whole set within a bounded distance of it
//!   by construction, not by measurement after the fact.
//! - **The data cursor** starts at `reserved`, the volume's very first
//!   allocatable block, and serves file content. On a freshly formatted
//!   volume the root sits at the midpoint (`canonical_root_lba`), so this
//!   is the *other* half of the volume from the metadata cursor — the two
//!   cannot collide while each stays inside its own half, which mirrors
//!   ReOrg's own "directory area and file area... stored consecutively"
//!   free-space mode (survey §1) rather than inventing a new one. If the
//!   data cursor's half fills first (a data-heavy volume), it falls in
//!   behind the metadata cursor and the two share one frontier from then
//!   on — graceful degradation, not a hard limit at the halfway mark.
//!
//! **Where `T_LIST` extension blocks go — measured, not just reasoned.**
//! A first pass at this policy put extension blocks with the header, on
//! the theory that an extension block is an index structure rather than
//! file content. That theory is wrong about what a reader actually does
//! with one: `T_LIST` is **streaming** structure, not directory
//! structure. A header is read once, at open, before any data read is in
//! flight; a directory's dircache is read during a walk with no file
//! read in flight either. An extension block is different in kind — it
//! is fetched *mid-stream*, between the last data block of the table it
//! closes and the first data block of the table it opens, by a reader
//! that is actively reading the file's bytes and immediately needs the
//! next pointer to keep going. Pulling it away to the root cluster does
//! not remove it from the read path the way a header's one-time fetch
//! can be amortized; it inserts two long seeks — root to stream position
//! and back — into the middle of every extension-block boundary. This
//! was measured, not just reasoned about: the same real-Kickstart-3.1
//! rig `docs/layout-survey.md` §4a uses timed both placements, root
//! cluster against interleaved, on the identical 391-block file, and
//! interleaved won (19 s versus 21 s — see the addendum in §4a). So
//! extension blocks are allocated from the **data cursor**, at their
//! natural position in the write order — between the two data blocks
//! either side of them, exactly where `TL_EXTENSION` already chains them
//! — which keeps them physically adjacent to the stream instead of
//! detached from it.
//!
//! One consequence worth being honest about: a data-block run that
//! crosses an extension block is not a single *ascending* LBA run in the
//! narrowest sense ([`FileChain::blocks`](crate::FileChain::blocks) alone
//! has a one-block gap at each extension boundary) — but it is one
//! physically contiguous run on the medium, which is the property that
//! actually costs seeks, and the one a correct run-count has to measure:
//! the full sequence a reader's head travels, extension blocks spliced
//! in at the point the read path fetches them, not the data pointers
//! alone. (OFS's own per-block header and checksum do not change any of
//! this: a data block is still one LBA in the chain either way, raw
//! payload on FFS or six longwords shorter on OFS.)
//!
//! **Headers are still different, and still near the root.** A file's
//! header is not part of the stream the way an extension block is — it
//! is consulted once, to find `byte_size` and the first data pointer,
//! before streaming starts, the same one-time cost a directory walk pays
//! for every header it touches. So it keeps the metadata-cursor
//! placement the survey's top recommendation asks for (§6a-2): near the
//! root, with the rest of its directory's metadata, not next to its own
//! data. The trade this gives up — a header immediately adjacent to its
//! file's first data block, true by accident of the single forward
//! cursor before this policy existed (survey §6a-3) — is deliberate and
//! stays deliberate: metadata locality is the effect ReOrg's own author
//! called dominant (survey §1) and the one that transfers to every
//! medium including flash (survey §3), while a header pays its distance
//! from the root exactly once per open, not once per extension-block
//! boundary the way a misplaced `T_LIST` block would.
